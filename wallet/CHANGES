  After sending, you'll see the paid fee in the transaction list.

* The app now requires Android 4.0.3 or higher. This makes UI development much
  easier in future.

  signature and cannot pay directly via HTTPS. The chances of an actual exploitability on
  Android are very slim, but we want to stay on the safe side until things are clearer.
