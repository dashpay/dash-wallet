# Contributing Guidelines

We use Kotlin and Java for developing this app.  Java is used on legacy components
and the underlying dashj library. New features are written in Kotlin.

General information on developing conventions can be found at [AOSP Java Code Style
for Contributors](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style).

While our code style is not enforced by git, please use the Code | Reformat Code
command in Android Studio.

However if you've got a question or would like to start a discussion, please post to
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dashevo/dash-wallet/issues).

If you would like to contribute language translations, we prefer if you use our
[Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/dash/dash-wallet/). Languages will be
synced from there regularly.
